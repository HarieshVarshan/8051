## basic elements in a microcontroller
---
- **the CPU or the processor**
	- the main purpose of a processor is to execute programs.
- **the memory** - any type of controller will have the below basic type of memory
	- **ROM (Read Only Memory) or Program Memory or Code Memory**
		- retains information even when the power is off.
		- to store the permanent things like executable program etc.
	- **RAM (Random Access Memory) or Data Memory**
		- needs power to hold the information.
		- to store data during runtime for faster access.
- **the bus**
	- buses connects the CPU, memory and other peripherals together.
	- types of buses,
		- **address bus:** it gives address to a select location.
		- **data bus:** transfers data between processor and the memory location. 
		- **control bus:** indicates if it is a read or write operation etc.
- **IO ports** - to connect devices like keyboard, mouse, printer etc.
	- we don't connect keyboard directly to processor's buses instead we connect it to an input port, likewise we connect monitor to a output port.
- **timers** - to produce a delay or time gap between two events
	- **hardware delay:** 
		- the delay is produced by the timer. (so that the processor can do some other better things.)
		- the processor requests the timer to create a defined delay, once the delay is over it informs the processor back. 
		- fyi, like processor the timer hardware also needs a clock to trigger the count/delay. the clock connected can either be external or can share the frequency of main clock of the processor.
		- it is more expensive, consumes more power, more complex as we need to connect the timer to data, address and control buses.
	- **software delay:** 
		- the delay is produced by the processor itself.
		- using loops (for loop, while etc.) say 1 iteration takes 100ms, 100 iterations will run for 10s.
		- blocks the processor from doing other essential tasks during delay.

## **example of microcontroller application: (microwave oven)**
---
- to store the programs of microwave, we need **ROM**
- to store the temporary data from the user like temperature, time/seconds and other settings etc., we need **RAM**. Every time we turn on for cooking the next day, yesterday's temperature is not essential to be stored.
- to get the inputs from the buttons (start, stop, timer etc.), to turn on the lights when the oven door is opened and for the oven display etc., we need the **IO ports**.
- to cook for a particular amount of time and to turn off after that, we need **timers** so that the **processor** can involve in other essential tasks like rotation of motors, maintaining the temperature by turning on/off the heater etc.
